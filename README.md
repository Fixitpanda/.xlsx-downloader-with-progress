# .xlsx-downloader-with-progress
This is 100% Python based script, which is downloading files based on the urls data you have in xlsx or csv files.


# How to use? Type:
download_loop('urls')


# What is 'urls'
Is the header name in your excel file, by default I called it "urls" but you can change to any header name even in different column.



# The script doesn't working, why?
1. Make sure your Python is updated (I am using python 3.10).
2. Make sure all packages is installed:<br/>
Run these commands in your CMD, terminal:<br/>
pip install pandas<br/>
pip install requests<br/>
pip install tqdm<br/>
pip install os<br/>
pip install time<br/>
